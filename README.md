Files
Source Code (src/)
chapter1_dynamic_risk.py: Implements the dynamic risk field model (Equations 1-5), calculating risk values based on UAV states and environmental factors.
chapter2_collaboration.py: Handles collision detection and resolution (Equations 7-11), including priority-based optimization (Equations 13-15).
chapter3_path_planning.py: Provides global and local path planning algorithms (Equations 16-20) for UAV navigation.
chapter4_main_experiment.py: Integrates the above modules for multi-UAV simulation, generating trajectories and logs.
chapter5_risk_factor_analysis.py: Analyzes the impact of speed and turn angle on the risk field (related to Figures 1-3).
chapter6_method_comparison.py: Compares the proposed method with A* and potential field methods (related to Figure 4 and Table 3).
utils.py: Implements A* and potential field path planning algorithms for method comparison.
